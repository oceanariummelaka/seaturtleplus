<p><h2>LeatherBack Turtle Fact</h2><br> Unlike all other marine turtles, the leatherback turtle does not have a hard shell. Leatherback is the only sea turtle that lacks a hard shell. Its carapace is large, elongated and flexible with 7 distinct ridges running the length of the animal. 
<br> Composed of a layer of thin, tough, rubbery skin, strengthened by thousands of tiny bone plates, the carapace does not have scales, except in hatchlings.
<br> Leatherbacks Feed on Jellyfish and Other Soft-Bodied Creatures. It is remarkable that this large, active animal can survive on a diet of jellyfish, which are composed mostly of water and appear to be a poor source of nutrients. </p>
